# Argent [![Build Status](https://app.travis-ci.com/robertfasano/argent.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/robertfasano/argent)
Argent is a high-level sequencing interface for ARTIQ which allows experiments to be defined as sequences of individual, non-overlapping timesteps, allowing for rapid prototyping through a graphical user interface. Experiments defined by the user are fed into a code generator to produce low-level ARTIQ syntax, resulting in zero in-kernel overhead.
